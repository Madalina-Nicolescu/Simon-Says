# Simon-Says - Christmas Edition :christmas_tree:
The classical Simon Says game using an 8x8 matrix, a 16x2 lcd display, a joystick and a buzzer


## How to Play :video_game:

The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of arrows and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of arrows randomly generated by the Simon. What is different from the standard version is that, when an arrow is displayed, a musical note of a carol is sung, so that, at the end of the game, you reproduce the entire carol.

The Simon is an excellent exercise to train your memory. The more you play, the more you stimulate and improve your memory.
