# Simon-Says - Christmas Edition :christmas_tree:
The classical Simon Says game using an 8x8 matrix, a 16x2 lcd display, a joystick and a buzzer


## How to Play :video_game:

The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of arrows and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of arrows randomly generated by the Simon. What is different from the standard version is that, when an arrow is displayed, a musical note of a carol is sung, so that, at the end of the game, you reproduce the entire carol.

The Simon is an excellent exercise to train your memory. The more you play, the more you stimulate and improve your memory.

## Task Requirements :pencil:

### Menu :scroll:

The principal menu consists of the following options:

- MAIN MENU
  - START GAME
  - HIGHSCORE
  - SETTINGS
      - BACK (TO MAIN MENU)
      - DIFFICULTY
        - LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
      - CONTRAST
      - BRIGHTNESS
      - MATRIX BRIGHTNESS
      - CLEAR HIGHSCORE
      - SOUND
        - ON/OFF
      - GAME SONG 
        - JINGLE BELLS
        - WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS
        - SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN
  - ABOUT
      - GAME NAME
        - SIMON SAYS
      - AUTHOR
        - MADALINA NICOLESCU 
      - GITHUB
        - MADALINA-NICOLESCU
       
The user can scroll through these options using the joystick and select one by pressing the button. 
When accesing a menu, a different image is shown on the matrix: highscore - :trophy:, settings - #, about - :question:

#### Start Game ‚èØÔ∏è
 - starts the game 
 - at the beggining of the game, the player has 3 lives. The game ends when the player loses all of their lives
 - a sequence of arrows is showed on the matrix, followed by a question mark. After the question mark display, the player shoud reproduce the seen sequence. If he guesses right, a check sign will be shown on the matrix. If he guesses wrong or too slow, he loses one of his lives
#### HighScore üèÜ
 - shows  highscore board
 - when a player has a score greater than the last highscore from the top, he is asked to introduce his name on the lcd display and the highscore board updates
 - the top 5 players are stored in EEPROM memory
#### Settings üî®
 - the user can change the difficulty of the game, the contrast and the brightness of the lcd or the brightness of the matrix
 - the values that the user set for these settings are stored in EEPROM memory
 - the user can reset high scores, but he will be asked for confirmation first
 - the user can turn on or turn off the sound effects
 - the user can choose one of those 3 carols to be his theme song when the game starts
#### About ‚ùì
 - shows the game name, the author's name and the github link of the game repository

### While playing the game
 While playing the game, the following details are displayed:
 - number of lives ‚ù§Ô∏è
 - score ‚òëÔ∏è
 - level üéÆ
 - time left ‚è≥


### Score and difficulty
Depending on the difficulty, the game has 3 levels:
 - Low difficulty: - +1 point/correct sequence, 12 seconds to reproduce the sequence, 600 ms delay between the display of every arrow
 - Medium difficulty: - +5 point/correct sequence, 10 seconds to reproduce the sequence, 500 ms delay between the display of every arrow
 - Low difficulty: - +10 point/correct sequence, 9 seconds to reproduce the sequence, 400 ms delay between the display of every arrow


### Code architecture
The project is divided into 11 headers, some of them corresponds to the hardware components, others keeping track of used variables.

 - LCD.h 
     - display the menus, different messages
     - main functions: 
        - updateMenu (calls the logic for every different submenu and then display the submenu)
        - showMenu (depending on the menu you are in and the menu cursor, it displays a custom design)
        - fillMenu (fills the "options" array for the current menu)
 - buzzer.h 
     - emitting sounds in different moments of the game and scrolling through menus
     - main functions: 
        - wrongSoundEffect (emits the sound effect for failure)
        - buzz (gets an index and a song number and emits the corresponding song's note)
 - eepr.h 
     - saving variables in eeprom
     - main functions: 
        - readIntFromEEPROM
       - writeIntToEEPROM
       - readStringFromEEPROM
       - writeStringToEEPROM
       - saveScore
 - joystick.h 
    - navigating through menus, used for input in the game
    - main functions: 
      - readSWState
      - yMoveJoystick
      - xMoveJoystick
 - matrix.h 
    - showing animations and displaying the game
 - photoRes.h 
    - adjusting contrast and brightness depending on the environment
    - main functions: 
      - photoResistorAdjust

 - constants.h
    - all the constants used
 - customChars.h 
    - all the custom characters created
 - globals.h 
    - global variables
 - notes.h 
    - tones used by the buzzer

 - game.h 
      - the game logic
      - main functions: 
        - addMove (adds a move to the sequence)
        - decreaseLives
        - decreaseTime
        - startGame (the game flow)
        - newRound (resets the time and shows again the sequence)


### Hardware components
 - ARDUINO UNO board
 - 8x8 matrix -> game display
 - 16x2 lcd -> menu display
 - joystick -> navigate through the menu and move in the game
 - buzzer -> sounds
 - photoresistor -> adjust contrast, brightness, matrix brightness depending on the amount of light in the environment
